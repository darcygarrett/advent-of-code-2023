# Advent of Code 2023
I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'll try to do a little bit between meetings. I decided to do it in python since it's been a while. If you're interested, you can find the problems here: [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

### Prerequisites
You'll need python 3.7 or higher. I'm using 3.9.1.

### Installing

I have a new laptop so I didn't even have python3 installed on it. If, like me, you need to install it, you can download it here: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions for your OS. I'm on a Mac so I also installed Pyenv with Homebrew `brew install pyenv` to manage my python versions and added the python extension for VS Code.

```zsh
pyenv install --list
pyenv install 3.9.1 (you can use whatever version you want)
pyenv global 3.9.1
```

Create a virtual environment for this project using pyenv:
```zsh
pyenv shell 3.8.1
python3 -m venv env
```
